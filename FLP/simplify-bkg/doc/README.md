# Simplify-bkg

Haskell program that applies simplifying algorithms (4.1 & 4.2 from TIN)

## Usage
```
./simplify-bkg desired-output-format [file]
```
If file is not specified, then it takes standard in as input.
The "desired-output-format" stands for three possible arguments, that can be only used separately.
```
    -i  outputs loaded grammar from inner representation without changes or ends up in wrong syntax error
    -1  outputs grammar after the application of algorithm 4.1 (deletion of states (non-terminals) that can not be changed to terminals in even multiple steps)
        this also deletes rules that cant be applied to do it and is mostly used to determine whether the language generated by grammar is not empty
        this does not change input alphabet at
    -2  outputs grammar after the application of algorithm 4.2 (deletion of unreachable states)
        this deletes unreachable states as well as rules that cant be applied from start in any way
        this also deletes unnecessary alphabet and also outputs special grammar
        that generates empty language even if it was already known from the output of algorithm 4.1
```

## Included testing script with small data set (usage)
```
./build.sh [-q]
```
The "-q" stands for a quick deletion of actual output files generated to subfolder /tests/out-actual from execution of simplify-bkg after comparison with expected values in /tests/out-expect.
Output stands for a correct/incorrect actual output.
